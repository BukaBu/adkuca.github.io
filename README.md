# Pixel Art Maker Project

## Table of Contents

The custom Color-Picker is from http://www.eyecon.ro/colorpicker/#about and I regret using this one :).

LMB/RMB to apply/remove color.

Click on the header to turn on/off glow. (might be laggy)

The "Lamp" sticks to top when page is scrolled below break.

The resolution changes on input-change.

Clear Canvas and Remove Canvas buttons are enabled/disabled depending on table and cell color existance.

The custom Color-Picker is draggable, can be turned on/off with checkbox.

The lamp can be disabled and unvisible, checkbox.

Color-Picker and Color type Input change colors depending on eachother.

Some elements glow at certain actions.
